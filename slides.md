What makes a zoom call "good"?

#
1. Good internet connection
2. Clear and loud dedicated microphone
3. Separate webcam properly positioned
4. Clear lighting
5. Tidy background or backdrop

#
What is a good internet connection?

- What challenges do we have?

#
Clear and loud dedicated microphone

- The built in laptop mic is usually not good enough to be heard clearly
- USB mics and headsets range in price

#
Separate webcam properly positioned

- Webcam should be on a stand and about eye level
- Your portrait should follow the "rule of thirds"
- Logitech Camera Settings app

#
Clear lighting

- avoid windows behind you
- avoid direct sunlight
- some light under the chin

#
Tidy background or backdrop

- move articles of clothing out of the "camera shot"
- position your desk to get a clean wall or bookcase
- include personal items if that suits you
- build or buy a green screen

#
