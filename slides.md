# How could Equifax have prevented this?

* Apply security patches regularly
* Consult with security firms for regular auditing and scanning
* Maintain and fund a company information security policy

# Regular Security Patching

* Software providers fix bugs and vulnerabilities in their software
* Researchers disclose problems
* Equifax must plan and staff regular updates

# Auditing and Scanning

* Find problems early
* Equifax should have regular (weekly, monthly, quarterly) security scans
* Internal and External
* Equifax should hire a private security firm to scan and test

# Information Security Policy

* patch management
* testing
* auditing and scanning
* log management
* controlled access

# Doesn’t Everyone Get Hacked?

It's an ever increasing risk of doing business.
If a breach does occur, follow your Incident Response Plan
